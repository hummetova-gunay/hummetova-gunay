👋 Hi, I’m Gunay!
I’m passionate about solving complex problems through algorithms and mathematical modeling. My current focus is on applying machine learning techniques across a range of real-world challenges. I'm also working on my MSc thesis, where I use the Finite Element Method (FEM) to simulate and analyze physical systems. I enjoy bridging theory with practical implementation, and I’m always looking to learn and contribute to impactful projects.
